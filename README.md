# Mathforge Notes

This project is a tracker for the Mathforge Notes pages at <https://notes.mathforge.org/notes/published/HomePage>.
Use the `Issues` tab to record errors and suggestions in the project.

## Roadmap (aka things I know need doing)

1. Add solutions for the 2018 puzzles
2. Add missing geometry facts and theorems
3. Track down missing puzzles

   (Once the 2018 puzzles are done, it'll be easy to use the wiki software to see what puzzles don't have solutions which will help identify these)
4. Add links to "further reading" for any puzzle that has it
5. Make the solutions and exposition more consistent
